In this project we will create a catalog management application (product, category, etc.) with a javaFx graphical interface using SceneBuilder, using the three-layer architector:
* The DAO layer: who handles access to the database.
* The Service layer: which handles the various treatments.
* The Presentation layer: which is responsible for entering it, checking and displaying the results using the MVC paterne designation.
